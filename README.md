# MixMore - The simple SideScroller

Hi all.

My first try at making a 3D game with the Unreal Engine 4.

_ATM_: 
- Only character does is jump and move. 
- No levels done.

*Developpment*: 
- User interface with menus and options. 
- A FirstPerson option to make the SideScroller a sort of FPS.

#TODO: 
- [ ] Mario like structure. 
- [ ] Enemies need to be created. 
- [ ] FPS view on power-ups:
 - [ ] Fire flower 
 - [ ] Flying feather

- *Improving by Reverse Ingeneering*
